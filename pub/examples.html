    <p style="font-family: Arial;">
      Here, we use PermForm.js to create a simple job application. By using
      PermForm.js, we can create this form with a simple JSON string.</br>
      The JSON for the form is on the left, and the rendered form is shown on the right.</br>
      The key features of the form include: 
      <ol style="font-family: Arial;">
        <li>Automatic grid alignment (each element is defined using a coordinate system)</li>
        <li>Auto save (close and reopen this tab, the form will save its state!)</li>
        <li>Input validation (the phone number field is set to be numeric type, the email is validated to be an email, and all the fields are set to be required).</li>
      </ol>
    </p>
